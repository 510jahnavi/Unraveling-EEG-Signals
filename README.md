# Unraveling-EEG-Signals

Epilepsy, a neurological disorder marked by recurrent seizures and temporary aberrations in 
cerebral electrical activity, presents formidable challenges in management, especially in cases of 
intractable seizures. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive understanding of the 
disorder, and the Children's Hospital Boston EEG database emerges as a pivotal resource in this 
context. This project encapsulates EEG recordings obtained from pediatric subjects grappling 
with intractable seizures, specifically collected post the cessation of anti-seizure medication. The 
primary objective is to delineate the characteristics of seizures and evaluate the viability of 
surgical intervention as a therapeutic avenue.
The inherent unpredictability of seizures in epilepsy patients underscores the critical need for 
efficient detection and response methodologies. This project endeavors to harness the power of 
machine learning methodologies to construct a sophisticated classification model. The model's 
purpose is to analyze EEG data and effectively categorize it into distinct seizure types. For this 
ambitious endeavor, we will leverage a prominent dataset : the CHB-MIT EEG Database. This 
datasets will serve as the bedrock for training and evaluating the proposed classification model.
In essence, this undertaking not only aims to contribute to the scientific understanding of 
epilepsy but also seeks to provide a practical and technologically advanced solution for seizure 
classification through the fusion of machine learning and EEG data analysis. The dataset selected 
offers a diverse array of EEG recordings, ensuring the model's robustness and adaptability across 
varying seizure scenarios. As we delve into the technical intricacies of this project, the 
subsequent sections will elaborate on data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, 
training strategies, evaluation metrics, and future work, collectively charting the course for a 
comprehensive exploration of epilepsy management through computational methodologies.
